# Financialization of housing and its implication for the right to housing

In the report presented by the special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Leilani Farha, there was a detailed and well articualted discussion on the paradigm shift in the housing sector due to the presence of **global financial actors** and **excess capital**. The report goes on to discuss the gross violation of human rights as a result of it. However, there is no denial of the human rights violation that has happened, I would like to present the case that there are certain merits to the financialization of housing as well. And under a proper legislative and judicial framework the negative aspects associated with human rights violation can be eliminated. The report itself present few suggestions with respect to India and Portugal to deal with the problems.

As discussed by Professor Shiller in the lecture 1, **“Finance is a technology, for Good or Evil”**. The report discusses the evil parts of the financialization of housing, but there are some good parts as well. It is for the people and their government to work on minimizing the evil parts and maximizing the good parts. I would like to discuss some of the positive aspects of financialization of housing and argue that with the right balance of regulatory framework financialization of housing can bring prosperity and positivity with it.

Housing sector is usually regarded as illiquid and less transparent. Financialization of housing market makes the sector more liquid and transparent. It becomes accessible to the wide array of people from different social backgrounds. Specially people, who have historically being denied ownership of land and houses, can acess the markets now. Although people who were historically disadvantaged, can now be disadvantaged because of jacked up prices. It is a step in the right direction towards leveling of field and breaking the monopoly of certain sections of society. With proper regulations and framework, providing the rules of market participation, the speculative trading of houses, commoditization of it and their prices can be bought under control.

Presence of large corporations can be positive for the society as well. If a corporation brings with it global innovations, new opportunities for locals and developments like airports and railways with it, it can bring huge benefits to the local society. However, proper monitoring should be done that the inflow of these corporations don’t cause disturbance in local environment, forcibily displacing indigineous people or harming the resources the locals depend upon.

In the book, Poor Economics, Professor Abhijit Banerjee and Professor Esther Duflo, discusses house as a saving instrument. “There are houses with four walls and no roof, houses with roof but no windows...If you ask owners why they keep an unfinished house, they generally have a simple answer: This is how they save.” Sometimes, a house is the only thing that stands between a person and a crisis. Lack of financial instruments, especially in developing countries for poor people sometimes leads to a situation where a piece of land is the only saving a person have. Financialization of housing makes the market more transparent and active. People can take loans from their local lenders against their house or sell it if need be. The presence of regulations cannot be stressed enough for this to stop big money from exploiting vulnerable people.

Financialization of housing market brings other financial innovations like insurance and acess to other financial markets for investing. Innovations like REITs plays an important rore in making market more efficient. Other financial innovations may include ETFs, mortgage loans (which are still not very common in emerging markets like India), CDOs and CMOs. In the past, some of these innovations may have contributed to destablization of financial markets and recession, but under proper regulation, they have a potential to financial inclusiveness by bringing down the cost of service of a loan, risk management for business and low interest rate for people.

With this, I would conclude that like any other thing, financialization of housing has a potential to do good as well. It just needs proper supervision from the regulatory authorities along with guidance from local people and government (as land is after all a very local issue). The right balance needs to be struck between free market and regulations. The policies needs to be dynamic enough to change with the chaning needs of society.
